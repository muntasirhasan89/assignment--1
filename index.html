                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>Everyone’s life is a different story.
                    Some of us experience a lot of good
                    happenings in life where other ones experience the exact opposite.
                    But it is necessary for anyone to
                    understand the fact that “life is full
                    of joy, sorrow, ecstasy, difficulties,
                    happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat etc.

                <h4>Vission</h4>
                <p>I am currently studying in class 8. I am just going to describe my life in short through words. So, I
                    am
                    living a student life nowadays. Student life is not so easy that everyone gossips about. A student
                    has
                    to manage a sort of things like studies, health, hygiene, friendship, and other duties.</p>

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>ost people don’t like hurdles and difficulties but I do because they make me a better version of
                    myself
                    after I conquer them. As I have a problem-solving attitude, I like to solve maths. In fact, maths is
                    the
                    perfect example of assessing one’s problem-solving ability.</p>

            <p>Myself is Muntasir hasan, Aged 17.
                As everyone else, my life is too
                filled with joy, sorrow, ecstasy,
                difficulties, happiness, sorrow,
                victory, defeat etc. But one needs
                to understand the fact that a life
                without ups and downs is a neutral life.
                And where is neutralism,
                there is a lack of adventure.</p>

            <h3>Developer without limits</h3>
            <p>I use to experience every moment of
                my life whether it is a positive or
                a negative one. Because experiences
                make you more bold and strong compared
                to the previous version of you. In fact,
                the negative ones are the reason behind
                your personal growth and improved personality.</p>
